## Is Shoko Server Mandatory?

My Anime 3 is not a standalone plugin and **requires Shoko Server** installed, configured and running in order to work
properly. If you haven't done this yet, [Download Shoko Server](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/) from our main website
and use the installation guides located in the menu on the left to properly install and configure Shoko Server.

:::caution[My Anime 3 - Future Development] 
My Anime 3 is no longer in active development and
has entered maintenance mode. Any developers interested in further developing My Anime 3, please contact **Elemental
Crisis** on the Shoko Discord.

### Installing My Anime 3

Like other MediaPortal plugins, My Anime 3 uses the MPEI installer, so you should already be familiar with how to
install plugins. Please note, My Anime 3 only supports the skins listed below.

While we have no plans to add support for additional skins, we'll always accept PR's on Github for new skins.

- Ares
- Avallanche
- Avalon
- Default Wide HD
- Streamed MP
- Titan

### Initial Setup

![MediaPortal Config](./src/assets/my-anime-3/MediaPortal-Config.jpg)

Once My Anime 3 has been installed, open the **MediaPortal Configuration** window and from the list of **plugins**,
select My Anime 3. Please note, Shoko Server will need to be running in order to make any changes.

We recommend going through each of the settings tab as there are a lot of unique options just for My Anime 3 and how it
functions in MediaPortal.

### Main Settings

![My Anime 3 - Main Screen](./src/assets/my-anime-3/My-Anime-3-Main.jpg)

Unless you're running MediaPortal on another computer or changed the port Shoko Server uses, the default settings do not
need to be changed. We also recommend using Shoko Server to **modify your import folders** to avoid potential problems.
Keep in mind, if running MediaPortal on another machine, you'll need to properly map the **Import Folder** path in **
Local Mapping**.

If **Ask before starting streaming playback** is checked, My Anime 3 will ask each time during file playback if you want
to stream the file. We recommend unchecking this box for users using MediaPortal and My Anime 3 on a different computer.

### Display Settings

![My Anime 3 - Display](./src/assets/my-anime-3/My-Anime-3-Display.jpg)

These are all **personal preference** settings that affect what you see and don't see in My Anime 3 so there is no right
or wrong way to configure them. You can also set the default audio language and subtitle language to avoid having to
change if the series you are watching doesnt't have the correct ones as default.

### Other Settings

![My Anime 3 - Other](./src/assets/my-anime-3/My-Anime-3-Other.jpg)

The Other section just contains a couple settings related to FFDShow processing. There really isn't a need to change the
defaults unless you want to increase or decrease the wait times for the listed setting.


# My Anime 3 Overview

## Accessing My Anime 3

Like with any MediaPortal plugin, you can access My Anime 3 from the **plugins** list on your menu.

Once its loaded, the filter list will appear offering a variety of default filters as well as any user added ones. If you want to **create new filters or edit existing ones**, you'll need to use Shoko Desktop. Select a filter that's populated, depending on the amount of entries in that filter it might take a few seconds to load. Additionally, if you notice a series information or images are incorrect or missing, its probably due to an incorrect TvDB linking. You'll need to use Shoko Desktop to fix the series TvDB link.

### Options Menu

![My Anime 3 - Options](./src/assets/my-anime-3/My-Anime-3-Options.jpg)

Once you've loaded a filter, you can access the options menu by scrolling over to the right or using your keyboard/remove to navigate over there.

Some of the settings, such as Display and Filters allow you to change how your series information and images are shown. There are four different display types you can choose from each with their own advantages so pick the one that best suits your needs.

### Continue Watching

![My Anime 3 - Continue-Watching](./src/assets/my-anime-3/My-Anime-3-Continue-Watching.jpg)

Similar to the filter by the same name, the Continue Watching will show you all series you're currently watching and allows you to jump back in right where you left off.

Right-clicking on a series will bring up the series panel that's similar to the one shown when in a series. You can mark the current episode as watched, play the previous episode or go to the series panel for the selected series.

### Utilities

![My Anime 3 - Utilities](./src/assets/my-anime-3/My-Anime-3-Utilities.jpg)

The utilities section contains similar functionality available in Shoko Server such as Run Import, Scan Drop Folders and Sync AniDB Data. If you need to access additional actions, you'll need to use either Shoko Server or the Web UI.

The utilities section also shows the current running command queues and provides a list of unrecognized files that can be re-scanned My Anime 3, however manually linking or running AvDump on for these files can only be done in Shoko Desktop.

### Calendar

![My Anime 3 - Calendar](./src/assets/my-anime-3/My-Anime-3-Calendar.jpg)

The calendar is pulled from AniDB and provides a quick look at upcoming shows.

Right-Clicking on a series will allow you to either bookmark the show or create an empty series for it. Please note, even on a **family friendly account**, content marked as **NSFW** will still show up on the calendar.

### Random

![My Anime 3 - Random](./src/assets/my-anime-3/My-Anime-3-Random.jpg)

The random section will pull a random series or episode from your collection.

There are various settings you can change to filter your results such as removing series/episodes marked as watched. Please note, it may take a couple seconds for a result to appear.

### Recommendations

![My Anime 3 - Recommendations](./src/assets/my-anime-3/My-Anime-3-Recommendations.jpg)

Recommendations are only generated if you've previously rated **at least one series**. Once done you'll start to see recommendations populate based off series you've rated. Series you've rated that have the same recommendations will be shown first followed by everything else.
