**Shokofin** is an anime metadata provider plugin for **Jellyfin** that works in tandem with **Shoko Server** to provide
metadata tailored to your personal anime collection. For information on what Shoko Server is and the benefits that can
come from using it to identify and manage your collection, visit our [Official Website](https://shokoanime.com/).

## Requirements

Shokofin is not meant to be used stand-alone and requires Shoko Server to be installed, configured, and running before
it can pull in metadata specific to your library. If you haven't done so, [Download Shoko Server](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/)
from our main website and use the [Installing Shoko Server](/getting-started/installing-shoko-server) guide to
properly install and configure Shoko Server.

Shokofin requires Shoko Server to already be setup and in use, and that the directories/folders you intend to
use in Jellyfin are fully indexed (and optionally managed) by Shoko Server. Without doing so beforehand, Shokofin will be
unable to identify any of your anime series.

## Install

Below lists the corresponding versions of Jellyfin and Shoko Server that are compatible with Shokofin. Be sure to install
the correct version for your setup to guarantee functionality.
