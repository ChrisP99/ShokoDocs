Before you start using the plugin it is important to connect the plugin to a running instance of **Shoko Server**. So head over to the plugin settings and provide the `Host`, `Username` and `Password` credentials and click the `Connect` button.

![Shokofin - Connection Settings](/src/assets/img/shokofin/Shokofin-Connection-Settings.png)

After you've established a connection to a running instance of **Shoko Server** then you're free to either use the plugin as-is or to change any of the other settings to your liking.

## Connection Settings

Host:

    - This is the URL leading to where Shoko is running. You can input a full url, or just the dns name/ip.

Username:

    - The user should be an administrator in Shoko, preferably without any filtering applied.

Reset the connection.

    - Be sure to stop any tasks using this plugin before you press the button.

## Metadata Settings

Main title source:

    - How to select the main title for each item. The plugin will fallback to the default title if no title can be found in the target language.

Alternate title source:

    - How to select the alternate title for each item. The plugin will fallback to the default title if no title can be found in the target language.

Description source:

    - How to select the description to use for each item.

Allow any title in selected language.

    - Will add any title in the selected language if no official title is found.

Add all metadata for multi-episode entries.

    - Will add the title and description for every episode in a multi-episode entry.

Cleanup AniDB descriptions

    - Remove links and collapse multiple empty lines into one empty line

Minimalistic AniDB descriptions

    - Remove any lines starting with '* ', '-- ', '~ ', 'Note', 'Source', and/or 'Summary'

## Plugin Compatibility Settings

We can optionally set some ids for interoperability with other plugins.

Add AniDB IDs

    - Enabling this will add the AniDB ID for all supported item types where an ID is available.

Add TvDB IDs

    - Enabling this will add the TvDB ID for all supported item types where an ID is available.

Add TMDB IDs

    - Enabling this will add the TMDB ID for all supported item types where an ID is available.

## Library Settings

If you wish to set the Series/Grouping setting below to "Don't group Series into Seasons", you must disable "Automatically merge series that are spread across multiple folders" in the settings for all Libraries that depend on Shokofin for their metadata.
On the other hand, if you want to have Series and Grouping be determined by Shoko, or TvDB/TMDB - you must enable the "Automatically merge series that are spread across multiple folders" setting for all Libraries that use Shokofin for their metadata.
See the settings under each individual Library here: Library Settings

Filtering mode:

    - Choose how the plugin filters out videos in your library.

    - What does strict filtering entail?

        - Strict filtering means the plugin will filter out any and all unrecognized videos from the active library.

    - What does auto filtering entail?

        - Auto filtering means the plugin will only filter out unrecognized videos if no other metadata provider is enabled, otherwise it will leave them in the library.

    - What does unrestricted filtering entail?

        - Unrestricted filtering means the plugin will not filter out anything from the active library.

Series/Season grouping:

    - Determines how to group Series together and divide them into Seasons.

        - Warning: Modifying this setting requires the deletion and re-creation of any libraries using this plugin.

    - Why can't I just refresh all metadata?

        - Currently, refreshing and replacing all metadata does not remove all the metadata stored by Jellyfin. Additionally, if two or more show's entries have been merged, they cannot then be unmerged. Recreation of the library is the only way to ensure that you do not have mixed metadata in your libraries.

    - What data is kept when recreating the libraries?

        - The user data for each file is still kept after deleting a library. User data includes any ratings, play history, watch status and the last selected audio/subtitle track for a file.

Box-set/Movie grouping:

    - Determines how to group Movies together into Box-sets.

Enable library separation

    - This setting can be used to have one shared root folder on your disk for two libraries in Shoko — one library for movies and one for shows. Enabling this will cause the plugin to actively filter out movies from the show library and everything but movies from the movies library. Also, if you've selected to use Shoko's Group feature to create Series/Seasons then it will also exclude the Movies from within the series — i.e. the "season" for the movie won't appear — even if they share a group in Shoko.

Specials placement within seasons:

    - Determines how Specials are placed within Seasons. Warning: Modifying this setting requires a recreation (read as; delete existing then create a new) of any libraries using this plugin — otherwise you will have mixed metadata.

Mark specials

    - Add a number to the title of each Special episode

## User Settings

Configure settings for:

    - Select a user to add, modify or delete the user settings for.

Enable synchronization features

    - Enabling this setting is mandatory to enable the sync features below. Select the sync feature you would like to use by enabling the checkbox.

Sync watch-state on import or refresh

    - Enabling this setting will import the watch-state for items from Shoko on import or refresh.

Sync watch-state after playback

    - Enabling this setting will sync-back the watch-state to Shoko after playback has ended.

Sync watch-state events during playback

    - Enabling this setting will sync-back the watch-state to Shoko on every play/pause/resume/stop event during playback.

Sync watch-state live during playback

    - Enabling this setting will sync-back the watch-state to Shoko live during playback.

Sync watch-state for restricted videos

    - Enabling this setting will sync-back the watch-state to Shoko for restricted videos (H).

Username:

    - The username of the account to synchronize with the currently selected user.

Password:

    - The password for account. It can be empty.

## Tag Settings

Hide unverified tags.

Hide art style related tags

Hide misc info tags that may be useful

Hide potentially plot-spoiling tags

Hide any miscellaneous tags

Hide any tags related to the setting — a time or place in which the story occurs.

Hide any tags that involve how or where it aired, or any awards it got

## Advanced Settings

Enable Crash Reporting.

    - Improve the plugin's stability by allowing Sentry to report any crashes, which helps us improve the plugin's stability. This may include paths to your videos involved in the operation, which some users may consider sensitive. We assure you that this data is used solely for diagnostic purposes. Participation is entirely optional but greatly appreciated.

Public Shoko host URL:

    - This is the public URL leading to where Shoko is running. It is used to redirect to Shoko if you click on a Shoko ID in the UI if Shoko and/or Jellyfin is running within a container. It should include both the protocol and the IP/DNS name.

Ignored file extensions:

    - A space separated list of file extensions which will be ignored during the library scan.

Ignored folder names:

    - A comma separated list of folder names which will be ignored during the library scan.

## Experimental Settings

Any features/settings in this section is still considered to be in an experimental state. You can enable them, but at the risk if them messing up your library.

Season ordering:

    - Determines how to order Seasons within Shows.

Automatically merge multiple versions

    - Automatically merge multiple versions of the same item together after a library scan. Only applies to items with a Shoko ID set.

Always split existing versions of movies before merging multiple versions

    - Always split existing merged items before starting the merge.

    - What is this setting for?

        - Enabling this setting will make sure there will be no merge conflicts by splitting up all the existing merged versions. It will probably also make the plugin do a lot of unneeded work 99.5% of the time, but will help for the last 0.5% that actually need this to be done before every merge. An example is ensuring multiple parts of a movie series (e.g. "Part 1", "Part 2", etc.) are not merged in core Jellyfin because they contain the same Shoko Series Id.

Always split existing versions of episodes before merging multiple versions

    - Always split existing merged items before starting the merge.

    - What is this setting for?

        - Enabling this setting will make sure there will be no merge conflicts by splitting up all the existing merged versions. It will probably also make the plugin do a lot of unneeded work 99.5% of the time, but will help for the last 0.5% that actually need this to be done before every merge.
