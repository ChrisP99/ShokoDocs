With Shokofin installed, there's a couple things that need to be done before it can be used as a metadata provider for
your anime collection. The goal is to get Shokofin configured to your liking in a way so that you don't have to visit
the settings very often once set.

## Connecting to Shoko Server

Before you start using the plugin, it is important to connect it to a running instance of **Shoko Server**. Head over to
Shokofin's plugin settings and provide the private host, username, and password to get that connected.

<EasyTable
  columns={[
    { name: 'Option', header: 'Option', width: '20%'},
    { name: 'Description', header: 'Description' },
  ]}
  data={[
    {
      Option: "Private Host URL",
      Description: "The local IP or hostname that your running Shoko Server can be accessed directly from wherever Jellyfin is running."
    },
    {
      Option: "Public Host URL (Optional)",
      Description: "A public IP or hostname that can be used to access Shoko Server when the private host URL is not accessible from your browser when accessing Jellyfin. Most commonly used when Jellyfin is accessed outside your network or other complex network setups. If you do not know what any of this means, leave this field empty."
    },
    {
      Option: "Username",
      Description: "The username to your administrator account for Shoko Server."
    },
    ,
    {
      Option: "Password",
      Description: "The password to your administrator account for Shoko Server."
    },
  ]}
/>

After you've established a connection to a running instance of **Shoko Server**, feel free to skim through the plugin
settings detailed below and adjust Shokofin to your liking. If the defaults work just fine, go ahead and skip to
[Creating a Shoko Library.](#creating-a-shoko-library)

## Configuring the Plugin Settings

The following will detail what each setting does and common use cases where necessary. Do note that certain options when
changed will require a library recreation for existing libraries that use Shokofin as a provider and will be indicated
where appropriate. Additional information on the subject can be found in the
[Recommendations and Limitations](/jellyfin-integration/recommendations-and-limitations/#TODO) section of the docs for
Shokofin.

### Metadata Settings

The following settings will allow you to customize what information Shokofin will pull in as metadata for your media
entries. Any changes to these settings will require you to replace all metadata for libraries that use the plugin as a
provider.

<EasyTable

    },
  ]}
/>

### Media Folder Settings

Configure the behavior for how your media will be treated by Shokofin. Any changes to these settings will require you to 
remove the library in Jellyfin, wait for the library to fully disappear from the Jellyfin homepage, and create it once again following the instructions at [Creating a Shoko Library.](#creating-a-shoko-library)

<EasyTable

Only applies to libraries not using the VFS. VFS managed libraries will always act as though Strict has been set.",
      Default: "Auto"
    },
  ]}
/>

### SignalR

SignalR is a feature that allows for real-time communication with your running Shoko Server so that Shokofin has the ability to react to certain types of events such as file events and refresh events. This means that when Shoko Server identifies new media or updates metadata for your media, Shokofin can immediately import new or update existing media in your library.

## Creating a Shoko Library

Before creating a library, be sure the plugin is configured to your liking as certain options may require creating a
library from scratch when changed due to how Jellyfin works internally. More information on the subject can be found in
the [Recommendations and Limitations](/jellyfin-integration/recommendations-and-limitations/#TODO) section of the docs
for Shokofin. Creating a new library rather than enabling Shokofin on an existing library is required due to the nature
of how Jellyfin and Shokofin work together.

![Shokofin - Library Dashboard](/src/assets/img/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Dashboard.png)

Let's get started by adding a new library in Jellyfin's dashboard. All important options that will impact your
experience with Shokofin is detailed as follows:

### Content Type
![Shokofin - Library Settings - Content Type](/src/assets/img/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Content-Type.png)

The "Shows" type is best for most use cases, as Shokofin will still display anime movies in the library unless
configured to separate movies from shows. If you configured Shokofin to separate movies, you will need to create a
"Movies" library as well as a "Shows" library.

Setting the type to "Mixed Movies and Shows" *will* work, but is not recommended due to quirks within Jellyfin, and with
how Shokofin works as a plugin. Any other library type is otherwise unsupported.

### Folders
![Shokofin - Library Settings - Folders](/src/assets/img/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Folders.png)

When specifying the media library's file path, be aware that any path you give must point to a directory with the same
contents that Shoko Server sees in it's configured import folder(s).

For example, if Shoko Server knows the import folder for your collection as `C:\ShokoImport\`, and Jellyfin is given a
folder `/mnt/anime`, as long as both directories contain the same things, Shokofin will be able to identify your media.
Pointing Jellyfin to further nested folders seen within Shoko's import folder will also work, such as `/mnt/anime/shows`
and `/mnt/anime/movies` given that both `C:\ShokoImport\shows` and `C:\ShokoImport\movies` also exist.

### Language and Country
![Shokofin - Library Settings - Language and Country](/src/assets/img/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Lang-and-Country.png)

With Shokofin, setting the preferred download language will not do anything unless a corresponding override was set in
the plugin's [Metadata Settings.](#metadata-settings) If a relevant override is set that makes use of the library's
language preferences, this is the value that will be used for determining the overridden metadata.

Country is not used by Shokofin at this time and can be left unset.

### Embedded Info
![Shokofin - Library Settings - Embedded Info](/src/assets/img/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Embedded-Info.png)

To prevent any possible clashing with Shokofin's metadata retrieval, leave these two options disabled as it can result
in mixed metadata and other strange behavior.

### Real Time Monitoring
![Shokofin - Library Settings - Real Time Monitoring](/src/assets/img/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Real-Time-Monitoring.png)

Real time monitoring can be enabled if you desire, which will let Jellyfin listen to file system events for new and
modified files. This option will not do anything however if your file system does not support these events, and is
especially common with network mounts like NFS or SMB shares. As an alternative, Shokofin provides a feature called
SignalR in it's plugin settings which will allow Shokofin to maintain a constant connection to Shoko Server to receive
and trigger updates for new and updated files/metadata. More information on configuring this feature can be found in the
[SignalR section](#SignalR) of this page.

### Metadata Downloaders
![Shokofin - Library Settings - Metadata Downloaders](/src/assets/img/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Metadata-Downloaders.png)

When using Shokofin, it is recommended to not enable any other metadata providers for all library types to prevent mixed 
metadata along with a slew of other problems from occurring. This is due to other metadata providers identifying the
media incorrectly or just clashing in general with how your collection is organized.

### Metadata Savers
![Shokofin - Library Settings - Metadata Savers](/src/assets/img/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Metadata-Savers.png)


:::danger[Important]
    **DO NOT** enable metadata saving using Nfo files with libraries managed by Shoko, and if any are present among
    your media library, **DELETE THEM NOW**. The reasoning behind this is that Jellyfin prioritizes metadata from Nfo
    files above any other metadata provider. This results in weird or broken behavior since Shokofin is unable to
    override metadata that's sourced from an Nfo.
    
    Either find any files in your library that have the `.nfo` extension using your file explorer and delete them, or
    run the following command in a terminal according to your operating system. Be sure to substitute the path with the
    location of your library.

    ###### Windows (Powershell):
    
    ```powershell
    Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\path\to\library\' '*.nfo' | Remove-Item
    ```

    ###### Linux:
    
    ```sh
    find /path/to/library/ -name "*.nfo" -type f -delete
    ```
:::

### Image Fetchers
![Shokofin - Library Settings - Image Fetchers](/src/assets/img/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Image-Fetchers.png)

Shoko should be enabled and set as the top-most image fetcher for all library types and categories. Any additional
metadata providers may be enabled, but can have mixed results where incorrect images are fetched. Ones that are
known to work without issue alongside Shokofin are the Embedded Image Extractor and Screen Grabber providers.

### Saving Artwork Into Media Folders
![Shokofin - Library Settings - Saving Artwork](/src/assets/img/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Saving-Artwork.png)

When using the VFS feature provided by Shokofin, it is recommended to leave this option disabled as the artwork would
end up saved into the symlinked file structure that Shokofin creates within the data directories of Jellyfin. For non
VFS managed libraries, this is not an issue and can be set according to personal preference.

### Merge Series Across Folders
![Shokofin - Library Settings - Merge Series](/src/assets/img/shokofin/Shokofin-Library-Merge-Series.png)

If you are using the VFS feature provided by Shokofin, this only needs to be enabled if multiple folders were added to
the library earlier on in the configuration. For non-VFS managed libraries, it is recommended to enable this no matter
what. Enabling lets Shokofin properly group your media into series that reflect your Shoko library without being limited
by Jellyfin and the media's underlying folder structure.

## Wrapping Up

Once you've confirmed the creation of your library after all that configuration, your library should be well on it's way
with pulling in metadata and getting your library ready for use. This may be a time consuming process, so feel free to
read through the [Shokofin FAQs](/faq#shokofin) or the
[Recommendations and Limitations](/jellyfin-integration/recommendations-and-limitations/) of Shokofin for any other
expectations and useful knowledge when it comes to the plugin.
