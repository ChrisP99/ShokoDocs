hoko Metadata does not come with an installer. Please follow the manual installation instructions below. This guide assumes you've
installed Plex into the **default install directory**, so make adjustments as needed to fit your installation.

Shoko Metadata is not a standalone plugin and **requires Shoko Server** installed, configured and running.
If you haven't done so, [Download Shoko Server](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/) from our main website and use the
[Installing Shoko Server](../../../getting-started/installing-shoko-server) guide to properly install and configure Shoko Server.

:::tip
Make sure Plex Media Server is stopped before attempting to install the Plugin and Scanners. Otherwise, a restart of
it might be necessary to make the scanner and metadata plugin work and appear in Library settings.

## Shoko Relay Vs Shoko Metadata?

Shoko Relay itself started as a personal fork of Shoko Metadata to add minor preferred changes. Over time, as more
changes were made, the difference between the two plugins started going leading it to eventually become Shoko Relay.

Below is a list of the main changes.

- Utilizes Shoko's v3 API for metadata retrieval.
- Lists the studio for series and movies.
- Lists writers and directors for episodes and movies.
- Applies ratings (e.g., 'TV-14', 'TV-Y') based on AniDB tags.
- Offers language configuration for series titles beyond Shoko's default.
- Enables an 'Alt Title' language setting for series titles, searchable in Plex.
- Provides options for episode title language preferences.
- Uses TVDB descriptions and titles from Shoko when absent in AniDB.
- Replaces vague AniDB titles with the series name and an episode type suffix.
- Combines movies and series in a single library.
- Merges multi-season shows from TheTVDB into one entry.
- Includes support for Credits, Parodies, Trailers, and special file types.
- Support for files with multiple episodes.

Both plugins excel at media playback; the choice between them boils down to determining which plugin aligns best
with your specific needs.

:::caution[Custom installs]
If you installed Plex using another method, then please assign the variable to your own, and make sure to use the
correct user when executing the steps listed below.
:::


## Windows

[Download Shoko Relay](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/) and extract the zip file. Inside the zip is a folder,
rename the folder to **ShokoRelay.bundle** and move this folder into the following directory.

```cmd
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins
````

Now you need to move the **Series** scanner into the scanner folder. If you never installed custom
scanners before, you might need to create the folder labeled **Scanners** manually. The **Series**
scanner is located in the following directory:

```cmd
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins\ShokoMetadata.bundle\Contents\Resources
```

Move  into the following directory.

```cmd
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server\Scanners
```

## Linux

First, we will assign an environment variable `$PLEX_HOME` that will point to the base directory for your Plex content.
This will make it easier to follow the guide, regardless of the Plex install method.

Below are the three most common install methods, and what you need to do for each one before you continue with the rest of the guide.

#### Bare-Metal Variable

Sign in with **the user responsible for running PMS** (replace `<username>` with the according username) and assign the variable:

```sh
sudo -u <username> -s /bin/sh
export PLEX_HOME="/var/lib/plex/Plex Media Server"
```

Some distributions may install Plex to a different base directory, or if you're running a custom install of Plex,
then either make sure or tweak the above variable to lead to your **Plex Media Server** directory.
If the above variable is not set correctly, then the guide will fail at the first step.

#### Snap (plexmediaserver) Variable

Sign in as `root` on your host-system and assign the variable:

```sh
sudo -s /bin/sh
export PLEX_HOME="/var/snap/plexmediaserver/common/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server"
```

#### Docker (plexinc/pms-docker)

:::caution
This section assumes you're using the official docker image (plexinc/pms-docker). If you're using any other image,
(e.g. linuxserver/plex), then either make sure or tweak the above variable to lead to your **Plex Media Server** directory.
If the above variable is not set correctly, then the guide will fail at the first step.
:::

Attach to the running **PMS container** (replace `<container name>` accordingly) and and assign the variable:

```sh
docker exec -it <container name> /bin/sh
export PLEX_HOME="/config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server"
```

### Installation Steps

Navigate to the **Plug-ins** directory of your install

```sh
cd "${PLEX_HOME}/Plug-ins";
```

Download and extract the latest bundle from GibHub using **one** of the following commands:

```sh
curl -L https://github.com/natyusha/ShokoRelay.bundle/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xzf -
```

```sh
wget -O - https://github.com/natyusha/ShokoRelay.bundle/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xzf -
```

Remove the suffix.

```sh
mv ShokoRelay.bundle-master ShokoRelay.bundle
```

Ensure that the **Scanners** directory exists in the base directory

```sh
mkdir -p "${PLEX_HOME}/Scanners"
```

Move the scanner into the **Scanners** directory

```sh
cp -R ShokoMetadata.bundle/Contents/Resources/* ../Scanners/
```
