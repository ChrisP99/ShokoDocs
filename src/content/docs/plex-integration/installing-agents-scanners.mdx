Both Shoko Metadata and Shoko Relay do not come with an installer. Please follow the manual installation instructions
below. This guide assumes you've installed Plex into the **default install directory**, so make adjustments as
needed to fit your installation.

Shoko Metadata and Shoko Relay are not stand-alone plugins; they depend on having Shoko Server installed, configured,
and running. If you haven't done so, [Download Shoko Server](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/) from our main
website and use the [Installing Shoko Server](../../../getting-started/installing-shoko-server) guide to properly
install and configure Shoko Server.

:::tip
Make sure Plex Media Server is stopped before attempting to install the Agents and Scanners. Otherwise, a restart of
it might be necessary to make the agents and scanners work and appear in Library settings.

## Shoko Relay or Shoko Metadata?

Shoko Relay began as a fork/PR of Shoko Metadata, intended to introduce features that were absent in the original. Over
time, as more adjustments were made, it developed its own unique set of functionalities. This development was due to
differing opinions on what the plugin should include, leading to the creation of Shoko Relay. You can read a list of
the [Changes from Shoko Metadata](https://github.com/natyusha/ShokoRelay.bundle?tab=readme-ov-file#changes-from-shoko-metadata)
to decide which plugin you'd like to use.

Both plugins are outstanding for media playback; the decision essentially comes down to identifying which plugin best
suits your needs


## Windows

Installing on Windows is pretty straightforward and requires minimal editing on your part. If you run into any issues,
retrace your steps and if still stuck, feel free to ask for help on our Discord server.

:::tip[VSCode]
We recommend doing the edits listed below in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or similar as Python is
space-sensitive and extra or missing spaces can break the file.

## Linux

Getting everything configured on Linux is a bit more involved than on Windows, but it's still relatively simple. If you
run into any issues, retrace your steps and if still stuck, feel free to ask for help on our Discord server.

### Prerequisite Steps

First, we will assign an environment variable `$PLEX_HOME` that will point to the base directory for your Plex content.
This will make it easier to follow the guide, regardless of the Plex install method.

Below are the three most common install methods, and what you need to do for each one before you continue with the rest
of the guide.

:::caution[Custom installs]
If you installed Plex using another method, then please assign the variable to your own, and make sure to use the
correct user when executing the
steps listed below.
:::

#### Bare-Metal Variable

Sign in with **the user responsible for running PMS** (replace `<username>` with the according username) and
assign the variable:

```sh
sudo -u <username> -s /bin/sh
export PLEX_HOME="/var/lib/plex/Plex Media Server"
```

Some distributions may install Plex to a different base directory, or if you're running a custom install of Plex,
then either make sure or tweak the above variable to lead to your **Plex Media Server** directory.
If the above variable is not set correctly, then the guide will fail at the first step.

#### Snap (plexmediaserver) Variable

Sign in as `root` on your host-system and assign the variable:

```sh
sudo -s /bin/sh
export PLEX_HOME="/var/snap/plexmediaserver/common/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server"
```

#### Docker (plexinc/pms-docker)

:::caution
This section assumes you're using the official docker image (plexinc/pms-docker). If you're using any other image,
(e.g. linuxserver/plex), then either make sure or tweak the above variable to lead to your **Plex Media Server**
directory. If the above variable is not set correctly, then the guide will fail at the first step.
:::

Attach to the running **PMS container** (replace `<container name>` accordingly) and and assign the variable:

```sh
docker exec -it <container name> /bin/sh
export PLEX_HOME="/config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server"
```

### Shoko Relay

Before you continue forward, make sure you have Shoko Server installed and running.

#### Install

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the Plug-ins Directory
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the `Plug-ins` directory of your Plex installation:
      ```sh
      cd "${PLEX_HOME}/Plug-ins";
      ```

2. Download and Extract the Bundle
    - Use one of the following commands to download and extract the latest Shoko Relay bundle from GitHub:
      ```sh title="Using curl"
      curl -L https://github.com/natyusha/ShokoRelay.bundle/releases/latest/download/ShokoRelay.bundle.tar.gz | tar -xzf -
      ```
      ```sh title="Using wget"
      wget -O - https://github.com/natyusha/ShokoRelay.bundle/releases/latest/download/ShokoRelay.bundle.tar.gz | tar -xzf -
      ```

3. Move the Scanner
    - Copy the `Scanners` folder from the extracted bundle to the `${PLEX_HOME}` directory:
      ```sh
      cp -R ShokoRelay.bundle/Contents/Scanners ../
      ```
</Steps>

#### Editing Shoko Series Scanner

If you closed the window, open file explorer and navigate to the following.

<Steps>
1. Open the Shoko Series Scanner.py file:
      ```sh
      ${EDITOR:-nano} "${PLEX_HOME}/Scanners/Series/Shoko Series Scanner.py"
      ```
2. Make adjustments to the Prefs section to align it with your Shoko configuration. For most users, you'll only need
to update the username and password fields:
    ```py
    Prefs = {
        'Hostname': '127.0.0.1',
        'Port': 8111,
        'Username': 'username',
        'Password': 'password',
        'SingleSeasonOrdering': False
