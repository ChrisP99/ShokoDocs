#### Creating A Shoko Library

While Shoko Server is running, open Plex and create a new library. You can either choose Movies or TV Shows.
Please note that if you haven't completed the **required edits** mentioned on the
[Installing Agents & Scanners](../installing-agents-scanners/#editing-shoko-movie-scanner) page, please go back and do so now.

When prompted to select the Media Folder, browse to your anime collection. Even though Shoko will provide the
metadata, Plex still needs to know where the physical files are located.

In the Advanced tab, if you're adding a TV library, select: Scanner **Shoko Series Scanner** and Agent **ShokoTV**. If you're adding a
movie library, choose: Scanner **Shoko Series Scanner** and Agent **ShokoMovies**.

You'll need to input the following information for Shoko Metadata to access your collection.

<EasyTable
    header={["Option", "Description"]}
    data={[
      [
        "Username",
        "The username for the **local account** you created during the **First Run** setup in Shoko Server."
      ],
      [
        "Password",
        "The password for the **local account** you created during the **First Run** setup in Shoko Server.",
      ],
      [
        "Server IP",
        "The IP address for the computer where Shoko Server is located. This can be left blank unless Shoko Server is running on a different computer.",
      ],
      [
        "Port",
        "The port Shoko Server uses, by default it's **8111**",
      ],
      [
        "Use Single Season Ordering",
        "If you set **SingleSeasonOrdering** to True during the install process, make sure you check this box."
      ]
    ]}
    columnWidths={{ Option: "30%", Description: "70%" }}
/>

Once you've reviewed and configured the remaining options, which are self-explanatory, click the **Add Library** button.
After adding the library, initiate a scan within Plex and wait for Plex to add your collection.
