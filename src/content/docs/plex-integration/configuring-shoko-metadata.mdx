## Creating A Shoko Library

While Shoko Server is running, open Plex and create a new library. You can either choose Movies or TV Shows.
Please note that if you haven't completed the **required edits** mentioned on the
[Installing Agents & Scanners](../installing-agents-scanners/#editing-plex-scanners) page, please go back and do it now.

When prompted to select the Media Folder, browse to your anime collection. Even though Shoko will provide the
metadata, Plex still needs to know where the physical files are located.

In the Advanced tab, if you're adding a TV library, select **Shoko Series Scanner** and **ShokoTV**. If you're adding a
movie library, choose **Shoko Series Scanner** and **ShokoMovies**.

You'll need to input the following information for Shoko Metadata to access your collection.

<EasyTable
    header={["Option", "Description"]}
    data={[
      [
        "Username",
        "The username for the **local account** you created during the **First Run** setup in Shoko Server."
      ],
      [
        "Password",
        "The password for the **local account** you created during the **First Run** setup in Shoko Server.",
      ],
      [
        "Server IP",
        "The IP address for the computer where Shoko Server is located. This can be left blank unless Shoko Server is running on a different computer.",
      ],
      [
        "Port",
        "The port Shoko Server uses, by default it's **8111**",
      ],
      [
        "Use Single Season Ordering",
        "If you set **SingleSeasonOrdering** to True during the install process, make sure you check this box."
      ]
    ]}
    columnWidths={{ Option: "30%", Description: "70%" }}
/>

Once you've reviewed and configured the remaining options, which are self-explanatory, click the **Add Library** button.
After adding the library, initiate a scan within Plex and wait for Plex to add your collection.

## NEEDS UPDATING ONCE API KEY IS IN WEB UI

### Syncing Watch States using "Sync" action

In order to properly sync watch states, you will need to have **Shoko Desktop** installed which you can download from our [Downloads](https://shokoanime.com/downloads) page.

##### Link and Authenticate using WebUI

![Shoko Metadata - Plex Authentication](../../../assets/img/shoko-metadata/Shoko-Metadata-Plex-Auth.jpg)

First thing you'll need to do is authenticate which you can do by navigating to **Settings** in the Shoko Server Web UI. When you click **Authenticate** it will redirect you and have you log into your Plex account.

If successful, you'll see the following message.

##### Select Libraries using Shoko Desktop

![Shoko Metadata - Desktop Sync](../../../assets/img/shoko-metadata/Shoko-Metadata-Desktop-Sync.jpg)

Open Shoko Desktop and navigate to the **Settings** tab and select **Essential**, from there scroll all the way to the bottom, and you'll see the **Plex Settings For ShokoMetadata** section.

If **Plex Host** is blank, click the drop-down to select it, It's ok for the list to be empty, simply click the **Refresh** button below, and it should populate with your plex server. Once selected you'll then need to select the **Plex Library** that contains your collection. You can select multiple libraries if you've chosen to split your anime tv series and movies.

##### Setting Plex Username using Shoko Desktop

Open Shoko Desktop and navigate to the **Settings** tab and select **Users**. Select the User you entered during the install process for Shoko Metadata, enter your **Plex username** under "plex users" and hit "Save".

:::note
You can find your plex username in plex WebUI by clicking your avatar or circled letter in the upper right corner.

### Syncing Watch States for Plex Pass Users with Webhooks

If you are a Plex Pass user, you can use Webhooks to forward scrobble events to Shoko Server. You can skip the linking process in that case,
but it is still mandatory to [set the plex username using Shoko Desktop](#setting-plex-username-using-shoko-desktop). This way you don't need to run the "Sync Plex Watch Status" action manually.

:::note
Currently this only works with regular Episodes. Special, Other and Movie Type episodes can not be detected and won't update their status.
You need to run the "Sync Plex Watch Status" action or mark them as watched by hand in Shoko WebUI or Desktop.
Keep in mind, that you have to link your Plex Server for this to work.
:::

To set up a Webhook, open your Plex WebUI and go to Settings (wrench icon). Under your username in the left menu, Select **Webhooks**.

Click the button to add a Webhook and enter your Shoko Server URL: <code>http://`<shoko-server-ip>`:8111/plex</code> (replace `<shoko-server-ip>` accordingly).

Save your changes. Now when playing an episode and everything was set up correctly, you should see scrobble events in your Shoko Server Log.
