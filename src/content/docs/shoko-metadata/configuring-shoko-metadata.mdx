## Creating A Shoko Library

With **Shoko Server** running, open **Plex** and create a new libary.

Either select **Movies** or **TV Shows**. Note if you did not do the edit mentioned on the [Installing Shoko Metadata](../installing-shoko-metadata) page to combine the libraries, you'll need to repeat these steps for the other library.

When asked to select the **Media Folder**, browse to your anime collection. Even though Shoko will be providing the metadata, Plex still needs to know where the physical files are located.

In the **Advanced** tab, if adding a TV library then select **Shoko Series Scanner** and **ShokoTV** or if adding a movie library then select **Shoko Series Scanner** and **ShokoMovies**.

For users combining the library, make sure to add the library as a **TV Show** and use the **ShokoTV** agent.

![Shoko Metadata - Inputting Server Information](./src/assets/shoko-metadata/Shoko-Metadata-Inputing-Server-Info.jpg)

You'll need to input the following information for Shoko Metadata to access your collection.

<EasyTable
    header={["Option", "Description"]}
    data={[
      ["Username",
       "The username for the **local account you inputted during the **First Run** setup in Shoko Server."
      ],
      [
        "Password",
        "The password for the **local account you inputted during the **First Run** setup in Shoko Server.",
      ],
      [
        "Server IP",
        "The IP address for the computer Shoko Server is on. You can leave this blank unless Shoko Server is on another computer.",
      ],
      [
        "Port",
        "The port Shoko Server uses, by default it's **8111**",
      ],
      [
        "Use single season ordering",
        "If you set **SingleSeasonOrdering** to True during the install process, make sure you check this box."
      ]
    ]}
    columnWidths={{ Option: "30%", Description: "70%" }}
  />

The rest of the options are self-explanatory so once you've gone through them, click the **Add Library** button. Once the library has been added, initiate a scan within Plex and wait for Plex to add your collection.

### Syncing Watch States

In order to properly sync watch states, you will need to have **Shoko Desktop** installed which you can download from our [Downloads](https://shokoanime.com/downloads) page.

##### Web UI Settings

![Shoko Metadata - Plex Authentication](./src/assets/shoko-metadata/Shoko-Metadata-Plex-Auth.jpg)

First thing you'll need to do is authenticate which you can do by navigating to **Settings** in the Shoko Server Web UI. When you click **Authenticate** it will redirect you and have you log into your Plex account.

If successful, you'll see the following message.

##### Shoko Desktop Settings

Open Shoko Desktop and navigate to the **Settings** tab and select **Essential**, from there scroll all the way to the bottom, and you'll see the **Plex Settings For ShokoMetadata** section.

If **Plex Host** is blank, click the drop-down to select it, It's ok for the list to be empty, simply click the **Refresh** button below, and it should populate with your plex server. Once selected you'll then need to select the **Plex Library** that contains your collection. You can select multiple libraries if you've chosen to split your anime tv series and movies.

Now select **Users** in the Navigation on the left. Select the User you entered during the install process for Shoko Medatadata, enter your **Plex username** under "plex users" and hit "Save".

:::note
You can find your plex username in plex WebUI by clicking your avatar or circled letter in the upper right corner.
