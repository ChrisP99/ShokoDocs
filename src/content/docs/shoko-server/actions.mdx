Actions are tasks, or groups of tasks, that perform different functionalities based on the nature of the action itself.
Many actions are tailored for troubleshooting, aiming to address unique situations where errors occurred during the
import process or where an issue arose during the metadata download process, leading to missing or corrupted data.
Additionally, for every part of the automation process that can be disabled, there is a corresponding action that
can be run to preform that specific part.

Actions are straightforward, with their functions detailed below each action name. For reference, we've included the
same information below.
