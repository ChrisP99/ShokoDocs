The Series Without Files is a simple utility designed to help you remove orphaned series not properly deleted as well
as series created by accident due to a variety of reasons. For the majority of users, empty series hold no value, and
we recommend deleting them as you come across them.

To remove an empty series, click on it and then select the **delete** button in the utility navbar.
