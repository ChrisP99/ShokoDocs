The File Rename utility allows you to have Shoko renamer your files based on custom rules. By default, Shoko will
use [AniDB's WebAOM](https://wiki.anidb.net/AniDB_O%27Matic_-_Documentation:_Local_file_renaming) as the parser for
your renaming script. Additional parsers are supported, check out the [Available Renamers](http://localhost:4321/renaming-plugins/available-renamers)
page for more information on the available parsers.
