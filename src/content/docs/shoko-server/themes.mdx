Although the default theme, Shoko Gray, is an excellent choice, we understand that some users may prefer a different
color scheme. Instead of relying on third-party browser plugins like Stylus, users can effortlessly add and create
new themes without any coding experience required.

## Creating Your Custom Theme

This process is manual and involves the creation and population of the theme file. The theme files are stored in a
JSON template, and their location varies depending on your operating system which is listed below.

<EasyTable
  header={["OS", "Location"]}
  data={[
    ["Windows", "C:\\ProgramData\\ShokoServer\\themes"],
    ["Linux/macOS", "~/.shoko/Shoko.CLI/themes"],
  ]}
  columnWidths={{ OS: "25%", Location: "75%" }}
/>

After accessing this folder, you can create a new JSON file with any name you prefer, such as **my-theme.json** as this
is where you'll be putting the actual theme template located below.

### Theme Template

Here is the theme template that you can use to create your own theme. Please be aware that this is a JSON file, so
it's important to use proper quotation marks to avoid any issues with the file. We have provided the default Shoko Gray
HEX values for the theme settings, which you can easily replace with your own HEX values.

```json
{
  "name": "Theme Name",
  "version": "1.00",
  "author": "Your Name",

  }
}
```

### Transparency With Hex Colors

You can append a two-digit HEX code to the end of your HEX value to specify the desired opacity for a variable. In the
template provided above, variables like **panel-background-overlay** and **panel-background-transparent** utilize this
method to apply opacity.

The [following site](https://davidwalsh.name/hex-opacity) provides a comprehensive list of values and their
corresponding HEX codes you can use.

## Using a Custom Theme

After you've downloaded the JSON file, copy it into the theme folder as listed above. Then in the Shoko Web UI, go
into **Settings** and select **General** and look for **Theme Options**. There is a drop-down input you can click
which will list every properly installed theme.

If your new theme is not showing up, that means there is an issue with its structure, and it failed to load properly.
