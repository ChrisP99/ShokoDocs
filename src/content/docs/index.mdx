## Navigating Shoko Docs

Shoko Docs was designed to be easy to navigate and find the content you are looking for. 

Our navigation menu on the left lists **all currently available pages**. If the section or program / plugin you are looking for is not covered, you can either add it yourself (see below) or make a request in our Discord server for someone on staff to write it. 

You can also use the **search function** located in the top quickly find your desired content, each result is only listed once regardless of how many matches on a page were found.

## Help Make Shoko Docs Even Better!

Like Shoko itself, Shoko Docs is **open-source**, hosted on GitHub and mostly written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) making it incredibly easy to contribute.

To keep uniformity, we will ask that the following standards for any submission be applied when possible.

- Unless already used, do not use abbreviations.
- All explanations of functions must be clear and detailed.
- Provide examples when and if needed.
- Code commenting is optional.

If you have questions or need help, please contact us on Discord.
