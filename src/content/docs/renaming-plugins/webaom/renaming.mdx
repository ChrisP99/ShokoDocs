Note: results of renaming will differ from WebAOM in some areas.

A script is composed of a list of rules evaluated from top to bottom.  
`[[ELSE] IF {test}/ELSE] DO ADD {part}/SET {part}/FAIL`

This page will highlight the main differences from the WebAOM renamer as described on [the WebAOM renaming section on the AniDB wiki](https://wiki.anidb.net/WebAOM#Move/rename_system).

### Statements

Statements Absent: FAIL, RETURN

### Tests

Tests Absent: Q, C, J, P, L.

Tests Changed: U (Resolution Height), Z (Bit Depth).

Test Added: F (File Version), H (Episode type prefix), W (Resolution Width), M (Manually Linked: leave empty).

Numerical test operators were added: =, >=, \<=, \<, >.

Operators are used by prefixing the condition within the parentheses *e.g.* `H(>=2)`.

When using ; (AND) and , (OR):
* Tests are read from left to right, but all tests after an ; (AND) are evaluated before any , (OR) test is evaluated.
* If the first test and all tests after an ; (AND) are true, the result is true; then, if any OR test is true, the result is true.

### Tags

Tags Absent: %epk, %gen, %inv, %md5/%MD5, %qua, %sha/%SHA.

Tags Added: %dep (Deprecated), %grl (Group long name), %sna (Name of file on AniDB), %vdh (Video Height).
