description: Using the WebAOM renamer
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The WebAOM renamer is the default renamer that ships with Shoko. It re-implements the scripting language used in [WebAOM](https://wiki.anidb.net/WebAOM#Move/rename_system).  
There may be discrepancies between the results of this renamer and the original.

A script is composed of a list of rules evaluated from top to bottom

Limitations:
* This renamer is only fitting for basic renaming logic.
* File moving is not customizable beyond group-aware sorting


## File Moving

### Without Group Aware Sorting (Default)

By default, this renamer will attempt to move files into a flat `Anime Title / Filename` structure.

When determining the destination of a new file:
<Steps>
1. If there exists other file(s) associated with the same anime series, it will try to move the new file to the same folder as the first file (sorted by latest episode air date first) that meets these requirements:
    * It is inside an import folder that is not a `Source` drop type.
    * There is enough disk space to accomodate the file.
2. Otherwise, the import folder and subfolder are chosen as follows:
    * The first import folder (undefined order) found that meets these requirements is chosen:
        * It is marked as a `Destination`
        * The file path exists
        * There is enough disk space to accomodate the file
    * The subfolder is set to the Shoko preferred language series title
        * If the series title has illegal characters, they will be replaced with unicode alternatives. See: [the ReplaceInvalidFolderNameCharacters function](https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoServer/blob/master/Shoko.Server/Utilities/Utils.cs).
</Steps>
