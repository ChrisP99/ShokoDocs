Lua Renamer provides a programming interface for more versatile file structure and renaming scenarios. This page details how to author scripts and the scripting environment.

Check out https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/ if you are new to Lua.

## Using VS Code (Recommended)

1. VS Code + [the Lua extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) is recommended for script editing.
    * The script environment provides [LuaCATS annotations](https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/) for type linting.
2. Open the plugin's lua subfolder in VS Code via `File -> Open Folder...`
3. You can create a new .lua script or edit the existing `example.lua`
4. Note that renaming scripts in this folder aren't used directly by Shoko, you must add them yourself. See [Usage](./getting-started#usage)

## [The Example Script](https://github.com/Mik1ll/LuaRenamer/blob/master/LuaRenamer/lua/example.lua)

The example script provides a sensible default renaming template. Some variables may be customized at the top of the file, and can serve as a good base for your own script.

## The Environment

The lua environment is sandboxed, removing operations from standard libraries such as `io`, and `os`. See BaseEnv in [LuaContext](https://github.com/Mik1ll/LuaRenamer/blob/master/LuaRenamer/LuaContext.cs).
The script is run in a fresh environment for every file.
Only the output variables defined in [env.lua](https://github.com/Mik1ll/LuaRenamer/blob/master/LuaRenamer/lua/env.lua) will have any effect outside of the script.

* [env.lua](https://github.com/Mik1ll/LuaRenamer/blob/master/LuaRenamer/lua/env.lua)*: The starting environment, output variable values will change renaming/moving behaviour
* [defs.lua](https://github.com/Mik1ll/LuaRenamer/blob/master/LuaRenamer/lua/defs.lua)*: Table definitions available from Shoko
* [enums.lua](https://github.com/Mik1ll/LuaRenamer/blob/master/LuaRenamer/lua/enums.lua)*: Enumeration definitions
* [lualinq.lua](https://github.com/Mik1ll/LuaRenamer/blob/master/LuaRenamer/lua/lualinq.lua): A modified utility library ([original](https://github.com/xanathar/lualinq), [docs](https://github.com/Mik1ll/LuaRenamer/blob/master/LuaRenamer/lua/LuaLinq.pdf)) that adds functional query methods similar to [LINQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/)
* [utils.lua](https://github.com/Mik1ll/LuaRenamer/blob/master/LuaRenamer/lua/utils.lua): Additional utility functions can be defined here

## Script Settings

In addition to the `filename`, `destination` and `subfolder` output variables, these variables affect the result of your script.

* `use_existing_anime_location`<a id="eAnimeLocation"></a> If true, the subfolder with the most files of the same anime is reused if one exists. This takes precedence over the subfolder set in the script (default: false)
* `replace_illegal_chars` If true, replaces all illegal path characters in subfolder and file name with alternatives. See [ReplaceMap in Utils.cs](https://github.com/Mik1ll/LuaRenamer/blob/master/LuaRenamer/Utils.cs) (default: false)
* `remove_illegal_chars` If true, removes all illegal path characters in subfolder and file name. If false, illegal characters are replaced with underscores or replaced if `replace_illegal_chars` is true. (default: false)
* `skip_rename` If true, the result of running the script is discarded when renaming. (default: false)
* `skip_move` If true, the result of running the script is discarded when moving. (default: false)

## Notes for File Moving

<wbr/>Import folders are only valid destination candidates if they exist and have either the 'Destination' or 'Both' Drop Type. Using `use_existing_anime_location` allows for an import folder with 'Excluded' drop type to be picked. This may change in the future.
Destination defaults to the nearest (to the file) valid import folder.
Destination is set via:

* <wbr/>Import folder name (string)
* Server folder path (string)
* <wbr/>Import folder reference (selected from 'importfolders' array)

If destination set via path, it is matched to import folder path with converted directory seperators but no other special handling (relative path or expansion).

Subfolder defaults to the anime title in your preferred language.
Subfolder is set via:

* Subfolder name (string)
* Path segments (array-table, e.g. `{"parent dir name", "subdir name", "..."}`)

If set via a string subfolder name, directory separators within the string are ignored or replaced depending on preference.
