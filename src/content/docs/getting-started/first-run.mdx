With Shoko Server installed, the next step is configuring it, but first, you'll need to ensure that Shoko Server
is running.

For Windows users, you can check your system tray for the Shoko icon. If it's not there, simply launch Shoko Server.

Docker users will need to execute the command to start the container. While the exact command will vary from person
to person, it should resemble something like this:


```sh
docker run -d --name shokoserver --restart always -p 8111:8111 -v "$HOME/.shoko:/home/shoko/.shoko" -v "/path/to/anime:/mnt/anime" -v "/path/to/import:/mnt/import" -e PUID=$UID -e PGID=$GID shokoanime/server:latest
```

With Shoko Server running, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8111/](http://localhost:8111/) to view
the Web UI. If Shoko Server is on a different computer, replace **localhost** with the IP address for of the computer
Shoko Server is on.

If successful, you should be greeted by the following.

![Shoko Server - First Run - Welcome](./src/assets/shoko-server/shoko-server-first-run-welcome.jpg)

A default background image is used for First Run. Once you start building your collection, the background image will
be pulled from images downloaded for your collection.

## Local Account

![Shoko Server - First Run - Local Account](./src/assets/shoko-server/shoko-server-first-run-local-account.jpg)

You'll need to create an account to use Shoko. This account will allow Shoko to manage links to all supported metadata
sites, enabling the synchronization of watch states and collection status.

There are no password requirements for your local account. However, we **highly** recommend saving your login
information as we currently do not provide a user-friendly way to reset your password. If you do happen to forget it,
check the [Frequently Asked Questions](../../faq) page for information on how to reset it.

## AniDB Account

![Shoko Server - First Run - AniDB Account](./src/assets/shoko-server/shoko-server-first-run-anidb-account.jpg)

Shoko utilizes AniDB to compare your file hashes with its vast database, enabling a quick identification and addition
of series to your collection. You'll need to input your AniDB username and password and then click the **Next** button
to have Shoko preform a login test.

:::caution[AniDB Password Issues]
AniDB's API has an issue with passwords that contain non-alphanumeric characters. Please update your password before
attempting to initiate the login test.
:::

### What is AniDB?

AniDB is a **free** comprehensive anime database and file tracker used extensively by Shoko to provide metadata for
the series and files in your collection. At this time, **AniDB is required** to use Shoko, which means you'll need to
create an account if you don't already have one. If you're unsure about how AniDB operates, take a look at the
[AniDB Policies](https://anidb.net/policy) page for additional information and what they do with the data sent to them.

## Metadata Sites

![Shoko Server - First Run - Start Server](./src/assets/shoko-server/shoko-server-first-run-metadata-sites.jpg)

Shoko uses multiple metadata sites to pull information and images for the series in your collection. These options
are pretty much self-explanatory, but we recommend spending a couple of minutes going through them to configure them
to your liking.

:::tip[Relation Depth]
This setting determines how deep Shoko should go to gather information on related series for a single series in your
collection. If importing a **big collection**, we recommend changing the value for this setting to **1** to avoid
temporary bans from AniDB.
:::

## Start Shoko Server

![Shoko Server - First Run - Start Server](./src/assets/shoko-server/shoko-server-first-run-starting-server.jpg)

With the initial configuration out of the way, it's time to start Shoko Server. Click the **Start Server** button to
begin the process and should only take a couple of minutes.

If you do happen to get an error during this process, you can try starting the server again. If you're still getting
an error then we recommend jumping into our **Discord** server, so we can help solve the issue.

## Import Folders

![Shoko Server - First Run - Start Server](./src/assets/shoko-server/shoko-server-first-run-import-folders.jpg)

Import Folders are the physical locations where your files are stored. This implies two key points:
they **must be accessible by Shoko Server** and should be **always online**. If you're using **removable media**,
ensure it's connected before executing any **import functions** or **file checking functions**. This precaution is
necessary to prevent Shoko from removing entries from your collection database.

There are **two different types of Import Folders**. The first type is **Watch For New Files**, where Shoko adds the
contents of the folder to your collection. The second type is **Drop Type**, which allows Shoko to move files from
the **Drop Source** to the **Drop Destination**. You can use both systems simultaneously and/or apply them to the
same import folder.

To add a new import folder, click **Add Import Folder**. Then, input the desired name for the import folder and select
or type its location. Choose the **Import Folder Type** you want to use for this folder and click the **Save** button
to add it. If you need to add more folders, make sure to do so before proceeding.

## Data Collection

![Shoko Server - First Run - Start Server](./src/assets/shoko-server/shoko-server-first-run-data-collection.jpg)

At Shoko, we value the importance of improving our software while respecting your privacy. That's why we use Sentry.io,
a third-party service, to help us track errors and monitor performance. This approach allows us to enhance Shoko's
functionality based on real-world use.

We're aware of the concerns around data privacy and want to be clear about what we collect. The information we gather
is purely about Shoko's performance, like error messages and usage metrics. This data helps us quickly fix issues and
improve the software's stability and user experience. It's all about making Shoko better, not about collecting
personal details.

Rest assured, we don't collect any personal information that could identify you. We're not interested in the titles
in your collection or what you watch. Our focus is solely on enhancing Shoko's performance, using non-personal,
aggregate data to guide our improvements. Your privacy is important to us, and we stick to collecting only what we
need to make Shoko work better for you.

:::note[Additional Information on Data Collection]
If you have any questions or need further clarification regarding our data collection practices, please feel free
to reach out to us on our Discord server. We're committed to transparency and are here to address any concerns
or queries you might have.
