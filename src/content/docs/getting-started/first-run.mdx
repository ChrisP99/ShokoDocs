With Shoko Server installed, the next step is configuring it but first, you'll need to make sure Shoko Server is running.

Windows users can check their **system tray** for the Shoko icon and if not there, simply launch Shoko Server.

Docker users will need to run the command to launch the container, and while the exact command will be different per
person, it should look something like this.

```sh
docker run -d --name shokoserver --restart always -p 8111:8111 -v "$HOME/.shoko:/home/shoko/.shoko" -v "/path/to/anime:/mnt/anime" -v "/path/to/import:/mnt/import" -e PUID=$UID -e PGID=$GID shokoanime/server:latest
```

With Shoko Server running, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8111/](http://localhost:8111/) to view
the Web UI. If Shoko Server is on a different computer, replace **localhost** with the IP address for of the computer
Shoko Server is on.

If successful, you should be greeted by the following.

![Shoko Server - First Run - Welcome](./src/assets/shoko-server/shoko-server-first-run-welcome.png)

A default background image is used for First Run. Once you start building your collection, the background image will
be pulled from images downloaded for your collection.

## Local Account

![Shoko Server - First Run - Local Account](./src/assets/shoko-server/shoko-server-first-run-local-account.png)

You'll need to create an account to use Shoko. This account will allow Shoko to manage links to all supported metadata
sites, enabling the synchronization of watch states and collection status.

There are no password requirements for your local account. However, we **highly** recommend saving your login
information as we currently do not provide a user-friendly way to reset your password. If you do happen to forget it,
check the [Frequently Asked Questions](../../faq) page for information on how to reset it.

## AniDB Account

![Shoko Server - First Run - AniDB Account](./src/assets/shoko-server/shoko-server-first-run-anidb-account.png)

Shoko utilizes AniDB to compare your file hashes with its vast database, enabling a quick identification and addition
of series to your collection. You'll need to input your AniDB username and password and then click the **Next** button
to have Shoko preform a login test.

:::caution[AniDB Password Issues]
AniDB's API has an issue with passwords that contain non-alphanumeric characters. Please update your password before
attempting to initiate the login test.
:::

### What is AniDB?

AniDB is a **free** comprehensive anime database and file tracker used extensively by Shoko to provide metadata for
the series and files in your collection. At this time, **AniDB is required** to use Shoko, which means you'll need to
create an account if you don't already have one. If you're unsure about how AniDB operates, take a look at the
[AniDB Policies](https://anidb.net/policy) page for additional information and what they do with the data sent to them.

## Metadata Sites

![Shoko Server - First Run - Metadata Sites](./src/assets/shoko-server/shoko-server-first-run-metadata-sites.png)

Shoko uses multiple metadata sites to pull information and images for the series in your collection. These options
are pretty much self-explanatory, but we recommend spending a couple of minutes going through them to configure them
to your liking.

:::tip[Relation Depth]
This setting determines how deep Shoko should go to gather information on related series for a single series in your
collection. If importing a **big collection**, we recommend changing the value for this setting to **1** to avoid
temporary bans from AniDB.

## Start Shoko Server

![Shoko Server - First Run - Start Server](./src/assets/shoko-server/shoko-server-first-run-starting-server.png)

With the initial configuration out of the way, it's time to start Shoko Server. Click the **Start Server** button to
begin the process and should only take a couple of minutes.

If you do happen to get an error during this process, you can try starting the server again. If you're still getting
an error then we recommend jumping into our **Discord** server, so we can help solve the issue.

## Import Folders

![Shoko Server - First Run - Import](./src/assets/shoko-server/Shoko-Server-First-Run-Import.jpg)

Import Folders are the physical location(s) of where your files are stored. This means two things, they **must be
accessible by Shoko Server** and they are **always online**. If using **removable media**, make sure its connected
before running any **import functions** or **file checking functions** to avoid Shoko removing the entries from your
collection database.

There are **two different Import Folder Types** you can use. The first is **Watch For New Files** which has Shoko add
the contents of the folder to your collection. The second is **Drop Type** which has Shoko move files from the **Drop
Source** into the **Drop Destination**. You can use both of these systems at the same time and/or use them both for the
same import folder.

Click **Add Import Folder** to add a new import folder, input the name you'd like to use for the import folder and then
select or type the location. Decide on the **Import Folder Type** you'll be using for this Import Folder and then click
the
**Save** button to add the Import Folder. If you need to add additional folders then make sure to do that as well before
moving on.

### Installation & Setup Complete

Congrats, you've successfully installed and setup Shoko Server!

The install and setup guide is only meant to cover the minimal requirements required to get Shoko Server up and
running. However, Shoko does provide fine-tuned options for those who are not satisfied with the default settings. We
highly recommend going through all the available options in the **Settings** tab fine-tune Shoko and your collection
