import DockerCompose from "../../../components/DockerCompose/DockerCompose";

The installation process for Shoko varies depending on the platform you're attempting to install it on.We recommend
following the guide and not deviating from it unless you are familiar with what you are doing.

If your platform is not listed in the page navigation on the right, it doesn't necessarily mean that Shoko does not
support it. It simply means that no one has written a guide on how to install Shoko on your specific platform.

## Windows

Windows users have it the easiest, navigate to the [Shoko Downloads](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/) page and
download Shoko Server and unless you've been told otherwise, download the **Stable** version. Once it's done downloading,
runthe installer and follow the instructions listed, it should only take a couple of minutes to install Shoko.

## Linux

Follow the instructions below for running Shoko on Linux using Docker, which is the recommended solution for Linux and
NAS Systems supporting Docker.

Make sure you have docker installed before you continue. For most users are installing docker from their package manager
is advised, this way you will keep up with the latest updates and security updates. On the homepage
of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) you can find the installation procedure for your distribution of the
Docker Community Edition.

:::caution
We do _not_ encourage using Docker on Windows using WSL or Hyper-V containers. It creates an unneeded abstraction layer
which might cause unforeseen issues. You can do this at your own risk, as we can't support this setup.

## Docker Compose (Recommended)

Docker Compose is automatically included with all recent versions of Docker, so you don't need to worry about its
availability. However, if you're having issues or not sure, please refer to your NAS manual or the vendor's
website for confirmation.

It's worth noting that Docker Compose is the **recommended method** for installing Shoko using Docker because it
simplifies service management. We've provided a sample **docker-compose.yml** file below to make configuration easier.
This file consolidates all the settings, making them readily editable.

If you need to make changes to accommodate your setup, feel free to use the Docker Compose Builder below to update
the values according to your preferences. Otherwise, simply copy the outputted config.

## Docker (QNAP NAS)

Make sure you have Docker installed on your QNAP NAS before you continue. This package can be found in the App Center,
under the Name of **Container Station**.

:::tip
Users have reported  that using the **Container Station** for management can be rough at times. If you're running into
similar issues, we recommend creating the container using the instructions given under Docker Compose above.

For the app, you will need to gather needed information in the same way as described in
the [Docker command-line](#docker-commandline) installation.
:::

You can change (not all) settings, like autostart, of the container using Container Station GUI later, or use *
*Portainer**, which also lets you use the [Docker compose](#docker-compose) above in a **Stack** via an easy to use Web-GUI.
Feel free to talk to the community on our **Discord Server** about using **Portainer** or docker-compose on your QNAP
NAS.

:::note[Regarding Container Station v3]
The current version as of writing this is **3.0.4.533** which became available with **QTS 5.1.0.2466**.
If you are on an older version of QTS or QTS hero (ZFS variant of QTS) the available version and experience with
Container Station might differ greatly.We always recommend an up-to-date QNAP QTS + App Center updates for the best
experience and security.

## Docker (Synology NAS)

Make sure you have the [Synology Docker Application](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/packages/Docker) installed on your Synology NAS before you continue.
This package can be found in the Package Center, under the 'Third-party' section.

:::tip
As the management using the **Synology Docker Application** will feel a bit clunky, we recommend creating the container
using the instructions given under [Docker command-line](#docker-commandline) or [Docker compose](#docker-compose) above.

For the app, you will need to gather needed information in the same way as described in
the [Docker command-line](#docker-commandline) installation.
:::

If you want to use the Synology Docker Application, please follow these steps:

Open Docker from the Application Menu, then go to the Containers tab. You'll need to download the *
*[Synology Container File](../../../assets/data/synology-dockerfile.json)**. Replace the ``/path/to/anime``, `PUID`
and `PGID` and once that's done, go to Settings, Import and select the file you've just modified. Name the
container `shokoserver`, then apply!

:::caution[Daily Server and Synology NAS]
AVDump3 might crash since we are unable to modify the ```shm_size``` through the proprietary container format Synology
uses.
Because of this, we do not recommend running *daily server* on Synology NAS for the time being.

## Docker (TrueNAS)

Docker is not natively supported on this platform, as **TrueNAS Core** derives from FreeBSD. We recommend joining
our Discord Server and engaging with other NAS users to find a viable solution.
