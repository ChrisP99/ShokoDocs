## Is Shoko Server Mandatory?{.page-first-header}

The short answer, **Yes**.

Shoko Server is where all the magic happens. It acts as a central database for every program and plugin under the Shoko
suite allowing you to access, maintain and watch your anime collection. This also means that Shoko Server **must be
running** to use any other program or plugin that connect to it. Outside of file importing, Shoko Server is no more
resource intensive than other programs you probably have running in the background, so you don't need to worry about
Shoko Server eating up resources.

### Windows

![Shoko Server - Windows Install](/assets/images/shoko-server/Shoko-Server-Install-Windows-01.jpg)

Navigate to the [Shoko Downloads](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/) page and download **Shoko Server**, unless told
otherwise we always recommend downloading the **Stable** version. The installer will guide you through the installation
process and should only take a couple of minutes.

### Docker (Linux)

Make sure you have docker installed before you continue. For most users are installing docker from their package manager
is advised, this way you will keep up with the latest updates and security updates. On the homepage
of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) you can find the installation procedure for your distribution of the
Docker Community Edition.

First things first, download the image, and unless otherwise told, install the version tagged as `latest`.

```bash
$ docker pull shokoanime/server:latest
``` 

Now, you can run the command below, after substituting the paths below (the second and third volume mount point) with
path(s) leading to your library and/or import folders.

```sh
$ docker run -d --name shokoserver --restart always -p 8111:8111 -v "$HOME/.shoko:/home/shoko/.shoko" -v "/path/to/anime:/mnt/anime" -v "/path/to/import:/mnt/import" -e PUID=$UID -e PGID=$GID shokoanime/server:latest
```

If you want a more detailed explanation, then refer to the below table for a break-down of the above command:

			<br><br>
			If you do not assign a container name with the <code>--name</code> option, then the daemon generates a
			random string name for you. Defining a name can be a handy way to add meaning to a container. If you specify
			a name, you can use it when referencing the container within a Docker network.

			<br><br>
			In order for Shoko Server to manage your collection, you must map at
			least one volume to the container.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Note:</strong> You can mount multiple library folders, and/or import folders, and they can be named
			any way you like (e.g. /anime, /import, /export, /tv_shows, etc.).
			<br><br>
			When importing hard-linked files, be sure to mount the common root between your import folder and library
			folder. Otherwise you will get duplicate files, because the containers sees the mount-points as separate
			disks, and will copy-and-delete the file from the import folder to the drop-destination.

			You can instruct the server to run as a certain set of
			user/group ids. This makes working with permissions a lot easier since you can match your server with a
			local account without effort. The example argument will make the server run with the uid and gid of the
			current user, to find the value to use for <code>PUID</code> and <code>PGID</code>, you can run log into the target
			system, either locally or over SSH, and execute the id command, supplied with the username of the user you
			want to the server to run as.

			You can set the timezone with the <code>TZ</code> environment variable.

### Docker Compose (Linux)

To make management easier, we can combine all the previous items in a docker compose file.

In order to make this work, install docker-compose, a guide how to can be
found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on the Docker website. Once **docker-compose** is installed,
create a **docker-compose.yml** file anywhere on your system. Open the file and put the following inside, but remember
to substitute the paths below with path(s) leading to your library and/or import folders.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  shoko_server:
    container_name: shokoserver
    image: shokoanime/server:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      - "PUID=$UID"
      - "PGID=$GID"
      - "TZ=Etc/UTC"
    ports:
      - "8111:8111"
    volumes:
      - "$HOME:/home/shoko/.shoko"
      - "/path/to/anime:/mnt/anime"
      - "/path/to/import:/mnt/import"
```

This combines all of our previous configuration in an easy to read and edit format, and will allow you to create a
powerful startup script that could (for example) include a MySQL server, a download client, and anything else you can
think of thatâ€™s available in a docker format.

#### Synology NAS

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/packages/Docker) installed on your Synology NAS 
before you continue. This package can be found in the Package Center, under Third-party.

You will need to find your User ID before continuing. Log in to your Synology NAS using SSH and type `id`. 
You'll see an uid: note it down for later. To avoid getting your database cleared on updates, you should also 
create a folder in the `docker` shared folder named `shokoserver`.

Open Docker from the applications menu, then go to Containers. You'll need to download the 
[Synology Container File](/server/synology-dockerfile.json) and fill out the anime folder path and your User ID. 
Once that's done, go to Settings, Import and select the file you've just modified. Name the container `shokoserver`, then apply!

Please note that if you want to edit volumes or environment variables, you'll need to stop the container first.

## Next Step

Once the server is installed, follow the instructions on the [First Run Setup](/server/setup) page to configure your
fresh install of Shoko Server.
