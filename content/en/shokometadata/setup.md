## Creating A Shoko Library{.page-first-header}

With **Shoko Server** running, open **Plex** and either select **Movies** or **TV Shows**. Note if you did not do the edit mentioned on the [Shoko Metadata Install](shokometadata/install/) page to combine the libraries, you'll need to repeat these steps for the other library. 

When asked to select the **Media Folder**, browse to your anime collection. Even though Shoko will be providing the metadata, Plex still needs to know where the physical files are located. 

In the **Advanced** tab, if adding a TV library then select **Shoko Series Scanner** and **ShokoTV** or if adding a movie library then select **Shoko Series Scanner** and **ShokoMovies**.

You'll need to input the following information for Shoko Metadata to access your collection.

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Option</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Username</td>
        <td>The username for the **local account you inputted during the <strong>First Run</strong> setup in Shoko Server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Password</td>
        <td>The password for the **local account you inputted during the <strong>First Run</strong> setup in Shoko Server..</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Server IP</td>
        <td>The IP address for the computer Shoko Server is on. You can leave this blank unless Shoko Server is on another computer.</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td>Port</td>
        <td>The port Shoko Server uses, by default it's <strong>8111</strong>.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Please note, if you set **SingleSeasonOrdering** to **True** during the install process, make sure you check the **Use single season ordering** box, otherwise it will not take effect. 

The rest of the options are self-explanatory so once you've gone through them, click the **Add Library** button. Once the library has been added, initiate a scan within Plex and wait for Plex to add your collection. 

### Syncing Watch States

In order to properly sync watch states, you will need to have **Shoko Desktop** installed which you can download from our [Downloads](https://shokoanime.com/downloads) page. 

##### Web UI Settings

![Shoko Metadata - Plex Authentication](/assets/images/shoko-metadata/Shoko-Metadata-Plex-Auth.jpg)

First thing you'll need to do is authenticate which you can do by navigating to **Settings** in the Shoko Server Web UI. When you click **Authenticate** it will redirect you and have you log into your Plex account. 

If successful, you'll see the following message.

##### Shoko Desktop Settings

Open Shoko Desktop and navigate to the **Settings** tab and select **Essential**, from there scroll all the way to the bottom, and you'll see the **Plex Settings For ShokoMetadata** section.  

If **Plex Host** is blank, click the drop-down to select it, It's ok for the list to be empty, simply click the **Refresh** button below, and it should populate with your plex server. Once selected you'll then need to select the **Plex Library** that contains your collection. You can select multiple libraries if you've chosen to split your anime tv series and movies.
